# Caesar Cipher
A little collab program with a friend. For fun.
Requires an environment that accepts user input.

# To Know
Caesar Cipher - a simple cipher in which each letter in plaintext is shifted a certain amount in the alphabet as determined by the key
- key: number (int)
- plaintext: your message to be encrypted
- ciphertext: your encrypted message

Non-alphabetical characters (numbers and special characters) are unaffected. Can be used to both encrypt or decrypt.
